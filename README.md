# CSP451-Project
## Assignment Overview
CheckPoint 4 -Guide 3
This project covers Git conflict management, GitHub collaboratio
n, and automating tasks with GitHub Actions


Part A: Managing Git Conflicts - Overwriting Remote Changes
Reflection: The text in the terminal was red when I used git push --force. This red color acts as a warning that force-pushing is a risky operation since it can overwrite the remote repository, potentially discarding others' changes.

Part B: Managing Conflicts - Reset Local Commit Head
Reflection: After resetting the local commit head and pulling from the remote, the terminal text was green, indicating success. Resetting the commit head works by aligning the local branch with the remote branch, discarding any conflicting local changes. This ensures the local branch is in sync with the remote and ready to accept further updates.

Part C: Manage Conflicts Using Merge Editor
Reflection: During the merge process, I chose to combine both sets of changes from main and feat-body-text. This decision ensured that contributions from both branches were preserved, which is important for maintaining all work.

Part E: Quickstart Automated Workflow
Reflection: Automated workflows, like the one I set up with GitHub Actions, can be very useful in real-world projects by automating repetitive tasks such as running tests or deploying code. This frees up time for developers to focus on more complex work while also reducing the chance of errors caused by manual processes.
